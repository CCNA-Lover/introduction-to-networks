## Scenario
In this activity, you are given the network address of **192.168.100.0/24** to subnet and provide the IP addressing for the Packet Tracer network. Each LAN in the network requires at least **25** addresses for end devices, the switch and the router. The connection between R1 to R2 will require an IP address for each end of the link.
