## Step 1: Subnet the 192.168.100.0/24 network into the appropriate number of subnets.
a. Based on the topology, how many subnets are needed?<br><br>
b. How many bits must be borrowed to support the number of subnets in the topology table?<br><br>
c. How many subnets does this create?<br><br>
d. How many usable hosts does this create per subnet?<br><br>
**Note**: If your answer is less than the 25 hosts required, then you borrowed too many bits.<br>
e. Calculate the binary value for the first five subnets. The first two subnets have been done for you.
| Subnet | Network Address | Bit 7 | Bit 6 | Bit 5 | Bit 4 | Bit 3 | Bit 2 | Bit 1 | Bit 0 |
