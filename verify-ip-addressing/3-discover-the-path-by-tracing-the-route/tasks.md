## Step 1: Use tracert to discover the IPv4 path.
a. From **PC1**, trace the route to **PC2**.<br>
```PC> tracert 10.10.1.20```<br>
What addresses were encountered along the path?<br><br>
With which interfaces are the four addresses associated?<br><br>
b. From **PC2**, trace the route to the IPv4 address for **PC1**.<br>
What addresses were encountered along the path?<br><br>
With which interfaces are the four addresses associated?<br><br>

## Step 2: Use tracert to discover the IPv6 path.
a. From **PC1**, trace the route to **PC2**.<br>
```PC> tracert 2001:db8:1:4::a```<br>
What addresses were encountered along the path?<br><br>
With which interfaces are the four addresses associated?<br><br>
b. From **PC2**, trace the route to the IPv6 address for **PC1**.<br>
What addresses were encountered along the path?<br><br>
With which interfaces are the four addresses associated?<br><br>
