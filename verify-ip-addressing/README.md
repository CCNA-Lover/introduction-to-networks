## Background
Dual-stack allows IPv4 and IPv6 to coexist on the same network. In this activity, you will investigate a dual-stack implementation including documenting the IPv4 and IPv6 configuration for end devices, testing connectivity for both IPv4 and IPv6 using **ping**, and tracing the path from end to end for IPv4 and IPv6. Complete the Addressing Table Documentation.
