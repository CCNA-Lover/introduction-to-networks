You will receive one of three possible scenarios. In order to use the logical topology diagram that is provided with the instructions, use the device names in the Device Names Table below.

|Devices|Topology Diagram Name|
|:---:|:---:|
|4331 ISR Router|R1 |
|2960 Switch|S1 |
|PC-PT|PC-A|
|PC-PT|PC-B|

The addressing table to be used in the tasks is as follows:

|Item|Requirements|
|:---:|:---:|
|Network Address|192.168.10.0/24|
|LAN 1 subnet host requirements|100|
|LAN 2 subnet host requirements|50|
|R1 G0/0/1|First host address in LAN 1 subnet|
|R1 G0/0/0|First host address in LAN 2 subnet
|
|S1 SVI|Second host address in LAN 1 subnet
|
|PC-A|Last host address in LAN 1 subnet|
|PC-B|Last host address in LAN 2 subnet|
