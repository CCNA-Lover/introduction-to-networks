# Introduction
In this assessment, you will configure devices in an IPv4/IPv6 network. For the sake of time, you will not be asked to perform all configurations on all network devices as you may be required to do in a real network or other assessment. Instead, you will use the skills and knowledge that you have learned in the labs and packet tracers in this course to configure the **Town Hall** router. In addition, you will address the hosts on two LANs with IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and activate and address the management interface of the **Administration Switch**.<br><br>

You will receive one of several topologies.<br><br>

You are not required to configure the **IT Department Switch**, and you will not be able to access it in this practice skills assessment activity.<br><br>

All IOS device configurations should be completed from a direct terminal connection to the device console. In addition, many values that are required to complete the configurations have not been given to you. In those cases, create the values that you need to complete the requirements. For values that have been supplied to you, they must be entered exactly as they appear in order for you to get full credit for your configuration.<br>
**You will practice and be assessed on the following skills:**<br>

- Configuration of initial IOS device settings
- Design and calculation of IPv4 addressing
- Configuration of IOS device interfaces including IPv4 and IPv6 addressing when appropriate
- Addressing of network hosts with IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
- Enhancing device security, including configuration of the secure transport protocol for remote device management
- Configuration of a switch virtual management interface<br><br>

# Requirements by device:
## Town Hall router: <br>
- Configuration of initial router settings
- Interface configuration and IPv4 and IPv6 addressing
- Device security enhancement, or device hardening
- Secure transport for remote configuration connections as covered in the labs and - Packet Tracers in the course.<br><br>

## Administration Switch: <br>
1. Enabling basic remote management by Telnet
2. PC and Server hosts:<br>
- IPv4 full addressing
- IPv6 addressing
