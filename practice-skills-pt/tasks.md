# Step 1: Determine the IP Addressing Scheme.
Design an IPv4 addressing scheme and complete the Addressing Table based on the following requirements.

a. Subnet the 192.168.1.0/24 network to provide 30 host addresses per subnet while wasting the fewest addresses.<br>
b. Assign the fourth subnet to the **IT Department LAN**.<br>
c. Assign the last network host address (the highest) in this subnet to the G0/0 interface on **Town Hall**.<br>
d. Starting with the fifth subnet, subnet the network again so that the new subnets will provide 14 host addresses per subnet while wasting the fewest addresses.<br>
e. Assign the second of these new 14-host subnets to the Administration LAN.<br>
f. Assign the last network host address (the highest) in the **Administration LAN** subnet to the G0/1 interface of the **Town Hall** router.<br>
g. Assign the second to the last address (the second highest) in this subnet to the VLAN 1 interface of the **Administration Switch**.<br>
h. Configure addresses on the hosts using any of the remaining addresses in their respective subnets.
