# Step 1: Determine the IP Addressing Scheme.
Design an IPv4 addressing scheme and complete the Addressing Table based on the following requirements.

a. Subnet the 192.168.1.0/24 network to provide 30 host addresses per subnet while wasting the fewest addresses.
b. Assign the fourth subnet to the IT Department LAN.
c. Assign the last network host address (the highest) in this subnet to the G0/0 interface on Town Hall.
d. Starting with the fifth subnet, subnet the network again so that the new subnets will provide 14 host addresses per subnet while wasting the fewest addresses.
e. Assign the second of these new 14-host subnets to the Administration LAN.
f. Assign the last network host address (the highest) in the Administration LAN subnet to the G0/1 interface of the Town Hall router.
g. Assign the second to the last address (the second highest) in this subnet to the VLAN 1 interface of the Administration Switch.
h. Configure addresses on the hosts using any of the remaining addresses in their respective subnets.
