## Background
The ability to work with IPv4 subnets and determine network and host information based on a given IP address and subnet mask is critical to understanding how IPv4 networks operate. The first part is designed to reinforce how to compute network IP address information from a given IP address and subnet mask. When given an IP address and subnet mask, you will be able to determine other information about the subnet.<br>
