## Step 1: Determine the number of subnets needed.<br>
**Note: All italic expressions are to be determined.** <br><br>
You will subnet the network address *address*. The network has the following requirements:
- *LAN 1* will require *number* of IP addresses
- *LAN 2* will require *number* of IP addresses
- *LAN 3* will require *number* of IP addresses
- *LAN 4* will require *number* of IP addresses

## Step 2: Determine the subnet mask information for each subnet.
a. Which subnet mask will accommodate the number of IP addresses required for *LAN 1*? <br>
