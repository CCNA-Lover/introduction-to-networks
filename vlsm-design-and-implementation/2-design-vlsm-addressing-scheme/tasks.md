## Step 1: Divide the *network* network based on the number of hosts per subnet.
a. Use the first subnet to accommodate the largest LAN.<br>
b. Use the second subnet to accommodate the second largest LAN.<br>
c. Use the third subnet to accommodate the third largest LAN.<br>
d. Use the fourth subnet to accommodate the fourth largest LAN.<br>
e. Use the fifth subnet to accommodate the connection between *LAN 1* and *LAN2*

## Step 2: Document the VLSM subnets.
Complete the **Subnet Table**, listing the subnet descriptions (e.g. [[S1Name]] LAN), number of hosts needed, then network address for the subnet, the first usable host address, and the broadcast address. Repeat until all addresses are listed.
