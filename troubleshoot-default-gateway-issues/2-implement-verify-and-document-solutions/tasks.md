## Step 1: Implement solutions to connextivity problems.
Refer to your documentation in [Part 1](/1-verify-network-documentation-and-isolate-problems). Choose the first issue and implement your suggested solution. For example, correct the IP address on PC1.
## Step 2: Verify that the problem is now resolved.
a. Verify your solution has solved the problem by performing the test you used to identify the problem. For example, can PC1 now ping PC2?<br>
b. If the problem is resolved, indicate so in your documentation. For example, in the table above, a simple checkmark would suffice in the “Verified” column.
## Step 3: Verify that all isued are resolved.
a. If you still have an outstanding issue with a solution that has not yet been implemented, return to Part 2, Step 1.<br>
b. If all your current issues are resolved, have you also resolved any remote connectivity issues (such as can PC1 ping PC4)? If the answer is no, return to [Part 1](/1-verify-network-documentation-and-isolate-problems), Step 1c to test remote connectivity.
