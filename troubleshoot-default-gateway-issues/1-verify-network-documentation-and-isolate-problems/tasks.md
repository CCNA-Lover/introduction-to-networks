## Step 1: Verify the network documentation and isolate any problems.
a. Before you can effectively test a network, you must have complete documentation. Notice in the **Addressing Table** that some information is missing. Complete the **Addressing Table** by filling in the missing default gateway information for the switches and the PCs. <br><br>
b. Test connectivity to devices on the same network. By isolating and correcting any local access issues, you can better test remote connectivity with the confidence that local connectivity is operational.<br><br>
A verification plan can be as simple as a list of connectivity tests. Use the following tests to verify local connectivity and isolate any access issues. The first issue is already documented, but you must implement and verify the solution during Part 2.
