## Step 1: Connect PC1 to S1 using a console cable.
a. Click the **Connections** icon (the one that looks like a lightning bolt) in the lower left corner of the Packet Tracer window.<br>
b. Select the light blue Console cable by clicking it. The mouse pointer will change to what appears to be a connector with a cable dangling from it. <br>
c. Click **PC1**. A window displays an option for an RS-232 connection. Connect the cable to the RS-232 port.<br>
d. Drag the other end of the console connection to the S1 switch and click the switch to access the connection list. <br>
e. Select the **Console** port to complete the connection. 
## Step 2: Establish a terminal session with S1.

What is the prompt displayed on the screen? 
## Step 3: Explore the IOS Help.
a. The IOS can provide help for commands depending on the level accessed. The prompt currently displayed is called **User EXEC**, and the device is waiting for a command. The most basic form of help is to type a question mark (?) at the prompt to display a list of commands.<br>
`S1> ?`<br>
Which command begins with the letter ‘C’?<br><br>
b. At the prompt, type t and then a question mark (?).<br>
`S1> t?`<br>
Which commands are displayed?<br><br>
At the prompt, type te and then a question (?).<br>
`S1> te?`<br>
Which commands are displayed?<br>
This type of help is known as context-sensitive help. It provides more information as the commands are expanded.
