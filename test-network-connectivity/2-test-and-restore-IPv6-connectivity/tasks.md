## Step 1:
a. Click **PC2** and open the **Command Prompt**.<br><br>
b. Enter the **ipv6config /all** command to collect the IPv6 information. Complete the **Addressing Table** with the IPv6 address, subnet mask, and default gateway.<br><br>
c. Click **PC4** and open the **Command Prompt**.<br><br>
d. Enter the **ipv6config /all** command to collect the IPv6 information. Complete the **Addressing Table** with the IPv6 address, subnet mask, and default gateway.<br><br>
e. Test connectivity between **PC2** and **PC4**. The ping should fail.
## Step 2:
## Step 3:
Compare your answers in Step 2 to the documentation you have available for the network.<br><br>
What is the error?<br><br>
What solution would you propose to correct the problem?
## Step 4:
Implement the solution you proposed in Step 3b.
## Step 5:
a. From **PC2** test connectivity to **PC4**.<br><br>
b. From **PC4** test connectivity to **PC2**.<br><br>
Is the problem resolved?
## Step 6: Document the solution.
