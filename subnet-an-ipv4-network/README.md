## Background
In this activity, you will subnet the Customer network into multiple subnets. The subnet scheme should be based on the number of host computers required in each subnet, as well as other network considerations, like future network host expansion.<br><br>
After you have created a subnetting scheme and completed the table by filling in the missing host and interface IP addresses, you will configure the host PCs, switches and router interfaces.<br><br>
After the network devices and host PCs have been configured, you will use the **ping** command to test for network connectivity.
