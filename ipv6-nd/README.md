## Background
In order for a device to communicate with another device, the MAC address of the destination must be known. With IPv6, a process called Neighbor Discovery using NDP or ND protocol is responsible for determining the destination MAC address. You will gather PDU information in simulation mode to better understand the process. There is no Packet Tracer scoring for this activity.
